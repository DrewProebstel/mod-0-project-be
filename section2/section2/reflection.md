## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

3. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
  
  A conditional statement is a statement where a variable is either true or false. Examples of this would be if, elsif and else statements.

4. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
  
  If you need to do something if something is true. For example an if statement could check if a password was entered correctly before continuing

5. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
  
  ```
  if (condition)
    function
  end
  ```
  
6. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

   Using && between the conditions if both need to be true. Or || if either can be true
   
7. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:
```
   if (calories >= 2200)
    puts "You over ate today"
   elsif (calories >= 1800)
    puts "You ate the right amount today"
   else 
    puts "You ate too little today"
   end

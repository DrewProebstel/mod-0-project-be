beginning## Section 3 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

The workflow felt entirely different with the pomodoro method. I never actually learned how to touch type so I have been forcing myself to do that through this whole module 0. This has made the whole process a little bit exhausting as I am typing way slower than I was before (obviously this will pay off long term.) The forced breaks have been helpful because around 20 minuted I can feel myself making more mistakes and like I need a break. This is way better than just pushing through and finding myself staring at the screen wasting time.

2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

I found that I was about as focused as I thought I would be. I can do i solid 18 minutes before I start feeling distracted need a break. I knew going into this I would need to build a little momentum before I could be fully efficient for 25 minutes. My actual time estimating has been really good and I found that throughout mod 0 I was able to stick pretty close to my calendar I made at the beginning.

3. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?

 A hash can store a variety of different variables at once and they are not stored in any particular order. An array needs to store only one type of data and it has a defined manipulatable order.

4. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

```
pet_store = {treats: 3034, collars:42, toys:89}
```

5. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
```
p states[IA]
```

6. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?

p states.values

7. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?

If you needed to keep stats on a user of an online messaging board. Some of the info might be integers like the number of posts, others might be boolean like if the account is verified or not. You could not keep these different types of data in one array.

8. What questions do you still have about hashes?

I wonder why a hash would be better than multiple arrays with a specific array for each data type.
